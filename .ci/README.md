# Project verification

Run `sh .ci/check.sh` from a clean checkout with the Node/Python/package-manager versions listed in `project-checks.yml`. Python installs should run inside a virtual environment. The script installs the locked dependencies and runs this project's selected checks; failures stop execution.

`project-checks.yml` is a prepared GitHub Actions workflow, **not an active workflow**. GitHub rejected workflow creation because the connected OAuth login lacks the `workflow` scope. After authorizing that scope, place it at `.github/workflows/project-checks.yml` to run on pushes and pull requests. No deployment or secrets are configured by this template.
